                        JavaScript Class Features: A case study in TC39                        ES6 classes were intentionally minimal, containing only public method declarations. Now, TC39 is considering adding several other features to classes: private, fields, and decorators. In this talk, we'll see how these proposals work in detail, the process that got them there, and how you can get involved. TC39 needs your help to build features like these and the future of JavaScript.                        <hr/>

                        Who Takes Out Your Trash                        In our daily development lives, most of us don’t have to worry about unused objects gathering cobwebs and filling up the memory. All we need to know is that our language has a garbage collector that just comes by and makes our trash disappear. Somehow it figures out what should stay and what can go, our program can keep going without running out of space, and we don’t have to do a thing.

It is not in fact magic that takes care of the garbage, and this talk will show you how it’s done. First, we’ll explore how two of the most common garbage collection algorithms, reference counting and tracing, figure out what is ready to be collected. Next, we’ll see how we could get the garbage truck out of the way faster by using a generational algorithm, and finally we’ll have a brief look at how Python’s garbage collection works.

This friendly introduction to taking out the trash gives an overview of important aspects of garbage collection algorithms. It is specifically meant to be accessible developers of all levels and you’ll walk away with an understanding of and appreciation for all the hard work that goes on behind the scenes.                        <hr/>

                        Leak Hunting: Finding and debugging a memory leak in Node.js                        Performance metrics? Response time higher? Memory leak? We would walk through different memory leak situations to identify and analyze patterns that produce an increase of memory, CPU usage, and the load average over time, without any apparent reason. We'll start talking about taking the time to set up a proper test environment to repeat the exact same conditions as in production. Then we'll discuss how to access Node.js memory using V8 Inspector & Chrome Dev Tools, create a dump of the heap memory for the inspected application, with a lot of details about the memory usage, watching memory allocation in real time and finally a compilation of best practices about how we could end fixing the memory leak. In the end, we'll be able to use the right tools to monitor, understand, and debug the memory consumption of a Node.js application on time.                        <hr/>

                        Offline-First Collaborative Data Structures                        The web is growing bigger and bigger every year.
With the increasing rise of the mobile internet and
with users in places that have spotty or slow internet
we've have seen an increased interest in making things work
offline, without degrading user experience.

This talk is a hands-on talk about a series of data structures
that allow you to build complex websites that work offline and p2p,
whilst still allowing you to build collaborative applictions, such as
chat applications, shared TODO lists and more.

I'll be talking about cool new data structures such as the HAMT
(Hash Array Mapped Trie) on top of append-only logs and why this
is the future of the offline-first internet.

Expect modules you can use *today* to start implmenting great
collaborative offline-first applications and plenty of demos.                        <hr/>

                        Visualizing the Decentralized Web                        A new generation of peer-to-peer protocols is coming to the web. Browsers will soon be able to talk directly to each other, without the need for centralized servers. Exciting new applications and social networks are being created which put people back in control of their personal data. See how IPFS, the Dat Protocol and Secure Scuttlebutt work. This presentation will use interactive visualizations to demonstrate core concepts.                        <hr/>

                        Real-Time Machine Learning in JavaScript                        Real-time machine learning is a collection of statistical methods to obtain insights from continuous data streams. In this talk, I'll provide an overview of real-time machine learning algorithms and discuss how these algorithms can be implemented and used in JavaScript. I'll highlight why running these algorithms in JavaScript has several advantages compared to languages traditionally used for numerical computing, including the ability to perform client-side computations. I'll conclude by discussing best-practices and common pitfalls encountered when using machine learning algorithms within JavaScript environments.                        <hr/>

                        Haute Codeture                        What if, instead going for practicality, we used IoT to create fleeting moments of interaction and beauty? What would happen if others could interact with my clothing via a web app? I’ll share my story of how I got started with hardware and how it’s evolved into using fashion to create interactive, artistic experiences with strangers.                        <hr/>

                        Javascript で機械学習はじめよう                        Javascript で機械学習する時代が本格的にやってきた。
機械学習プロジェクトとなると、今までは Python や R などのプログラミング言語で記述することが多かった。しかし、最近 TensorFlow.js をはじめとする 機械学習のための Javascript ライブラリが登場しはじめたことにより、その状況は変わりつつある。Javascript で機械学習を記述することによって、ウェブサーバとの通信を必要としないウェブブラウザ上での学習・推論や、クライアントの GPU の活用など、さまざまなメリットを享受できる。
このセッションでは、Javascript で機械学習することの意味、そして TensorFlow.js を用いてウェブアプリケーションを構築する方法について実例を交えながら解説したいと思う。                        <hr/>

                        Node.jsでつくるNode.js ミニインタープリター＆コンパイラー                        「RubyでつくるRuby ゼロから学びなおすプログラミング言語入門」という書籍に感銘を受けて、自分でもミニNode.js インタープリターを作ってみました。それを通して変数や関数のスコープについてより深く理解することができました。
さらに以前から気になっていたLLVMを使って、バイナリを生成するミニコンパイラにもチャレンジしています。

                        Diagnose your Node.js app                        想定対象者: Node.js初学者（≠プログラミング初心者）から中級者まで

このセッションでは、コアAPIの視点からNode.jsの特性について整理し、自身のコードの診断ができるようになることを目指します。

初学者にとって問題の原因がNode.jsなのかv8なのか、あるいはlibuvかOSか、切り分けだけでも大変です。前半はコアAPIがどのように実装されているのかを理解し、切り分けのための土地勘を養います。

後半では
・ Tracing: 非同期APIのライフタイムや各種パフォーマンスの可視化
・ Profiling: stack profilerを利用した改善
・ Analysis: あえてアプリケーションをクラッシュさせて指標を得るpost-mortemの考え方
などの観点で、実際にコードを診断してみます。
Node.jsではどのような診断方法が用意・検討されているのか、最新動向を追ってみます。                        <hr/>

                        State of SEO for SPA                        SPAを作る人ならきっと向き合ったことがあるであろう課題、SEO対策。

昨年からPrerenderなどそれ専用のソリューションが出たり、Gatsbyjsなどの静的サイトジェネレータの隆盛もあり、取れる打ち手が増えてきましたが、世間には未だに曖昧な論拠に基づいた「SSR必要論」ないし「SSR不要論」が溢れています。

このトークでは「SEO対策」とは具体的になにを指すのか、SPAでSEO対策をする際の打ち手やそれぞれのメリット・デメリットはなにかを解説します。                        <hr/>

                        Service Workerを用いたキャッシング戦略 〜Wikiアプリケーションを例に〜                        ユーザーによってコンテンツが頻繁に更新されるようなウェブサービスにService Workerを導入して、ローカルに持てるリソースを徐々に増やし活用していく取り組みについてお話します。Nota Inc.で開発・運営する
Scrapbox という、サーバーサイドにNode.js (Express, Socket.IO)、クライアントサイドにReactを使用したフルJavaScript実装なWikiアプリでの具体例を示しつつ、他のサービスでも汎用的に採用できるキャッシング戦略を紹介します。

ネットワーク接続状況に依らずに記事ページの表示や編集を可能にすることを目指して私達が選択した、以下のような手法を取り上げる予定です。
・ Single Page Application として全ページで共通に使われる、最初のhtmlのキャッシュ
・ ホワイトリスト方式での静的リソースのキャッシュ
・ リンクをmouseoverした際のページコンテンツのprefetch

                        Vue.js/Nuxt.js で 実現できた PWA の リアルタイム動画ラップ・バトル・アプリ                        スマートフォンやタブレット向けのモバイルアプリは PWA (Progressive Web Apps) による Web 技術を使った形態が期待されてきています。
私たちは、全国規模で行われるモバイル・アプリ開発ハッカソンの予選で、あえてPWAアーキテクチャにこだわって開発し優秀賞を受賞しました。
わずか 24時間という開発期間で、リアルタイムな動画配信を使ったラップのバトルと観戦が同時に行え、観戦者がリアルタイムにフィードバック・エフェクトを返せるアプリを、通常５人チームのところ ３人の少人数で作り上げています。
モバイルアプリのハッカソンとしてネイティブ系開発チームが並み居る中で、唯一 PWA を 武器に戦い 受賞できたのは、Vue.js/Nuxt.js の 活用があったからといって過言ではないでしょう。
また PWA は CI/CD と 相性が良く Agile プラクティスの常にアクセス可能なプロトタイプ環境の提供が行いやすいです。
そして この特性と、Vue.js/Nuxt.js の Web Components による相乗効果が、開発の高速化と品質の向上をもたらします。
このように、スマホ・アプリ開発においても Vue.js/Nuxt.js は 非常に強力に機能します。
本セッションでは Vue.js/Nuxt.js で PWA の リアルタイム動画ラップ・バトル・アプリ を いかにして作り上げたのか、どのように活用したのか、Vue.js/Nuxt.js の 技術を、デモを交えて ご紹介します。
・ PWA(Progressive Web Apps) の 概要
・ Vue.js/Nuxt.js を 使った PWA な モバイルアプリ の 開発手法
・ GitHub、CircleCI、GitHuba Pages を 使った 常にアクセス可能なプロトタイプ環境を持つ PWA アプリ開発環境                        <hr/>

                        How I made critical code run much faster                        I have this critical piece of code. It has to run fast otherwise my clients complain. Also it is synchronous so I want it to have a small impact on the performance of the applications. This is the story of how I spent a week to gain microseconds in some very critical piece of code.                        <hr/>

                        Accessibility vs latest Web APIs. Can’t we just get along?                        Unfortunately, we still treat accessibility in the same way we deal with front-end development for older browsers, something to be done at the end. What if I tell you that we can use the latest Web APIs and still offer an inclusive and accessible experience.

In this talk, you'll learn how to combine Web APIs such as Speech Recognition and Geolocation, with performant Javascript techniques to create empathic user interfaces.                        <hr/>

                        A trillion points with Node.js                        I will be presenting our progress of using DAT to create a open-source visualization system for very large point-cloud data sets. This visualization system is entirely built on JavaScript and can enable new ways how we share and use data.                        <hr/>

                        Navi: painless routing for React                        Navi is a new kind of router: as your app's URL changes, it starts fetching the new URL's content, and then it *waits*. It then renders the page *once the content has loaded*.

Delayed rendering makes routing simpler. Instead of manually managing component state and loading spinners, you just assign URLs to content using `async`/`await` and `import()`. Navi does the rest -- it fetches your content, manages your page's `&lt;title&gt;` and scroll position, and even warns you about broken links!

In this talk, I'll introduce Navi, and use it to live code a static website with create-react-app.                        <hr/>

                        Angular Universal on Google App Engine                        今年の6月からNode.jsがサポートされたGoogle App Engine Standard Environmentで、Angularアプリケーションをserver-side rendering (SSR)した事例についてご紹介します。

Angular UniversalはAngularでSSRを可能にするためのプロジェクトであり、今回のアプリケーションはこのプロジェクトが提供するツールを利用しています。現時点で公式ドキュメントがあまり充実していないため、実際にアプリケーション開発を進める中で得られた知見を共有することで、その部分を補ればと思います。たとえば、開発中にローカルでファイルをwatchしながらSSRする方法や、サーバサイドで取得した状態をクライアントサイドに伝播する方法などが含まれます。

また、Angular Universalでは未提供の、必要なリソースをHTTP/2 Server Pushする機能を独自に実装し（ようとし）たお話もする予定です。                        <hr/>

                        React + Apollo Client (GraphQL) により変化するアプリケーション設計                        GraphQL を利用した Web アプリケーション開発において、Apollo Client を導入することによりクライアントの設計は大きく変化します。コードはより容易に簡素化され、関心事の分離という観点からも GraphQL を導入するメリットをより大きくしてくれます。
このトークでは Apollo についてや、それによってどのようにクライアントの設計が変わってくるのかという話をしたいと思います。                        <hr/>

                        Workshop: Building a Small Compiler in JavaScript                        "Compilers" are usually-mysterious things that a lot of us actually use and rely on from day to day, eg. the JavaScript V8 compiler, the TypeScript compiler, or the Clang+LLVM compilers. Digging into how these work can be satisfying (like sleuthing a good puzzle); but some of the ways we implement them can appear in other forms, such as when validating user input, transforming big structures, or when separating side-effects from business logic.

This workshop is comprised of a short talk that introduces the main parts of a compiler, followed by an at-your-own-pace tour through building a little one of your own. We'll start with a simple language that compiles to JavaScript.

We'll be stepping through:

・ Tokenising (taking a string and turning it into a bunch of symbols),
・ Token Parsing (taking these symbols and turning it into a representation of a program), and
・ Code Generating (taking that representation and turning it into, in this case, JavaScript).

This workshop is for people who are already somewhat familiar with JavaScript (just the language itself, not any particular library or framework). To get started, you only need the workshop git repository (TBA), a Terminal / Console, Node.js 8+, and a text editor of your choice.                        <hr/>
